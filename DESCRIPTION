Description: Functions for applying manifold-and-eigenmapping methods to
  high-dimensional speech data to learn low-dimensional representations of
  speech for phonetic analysis. Includes a data set that comprises productions 
  of the sibilant fricatives /s, S/ by native American English-speaking adults, 
  productions by native American English-acquiring two- and three-year-old 
  children, and ratings of the children's productions by native American 
  English-speaking adult listeners. Includes a vignette on how to construct
  a manifold from speech data and then eigenmap it to a low-dimensional
  representation on which phonetic analysis can proceed. Accompanies the 
  manuscript: A. R. Plummer and P. F. Reidy (submitted). "Computing 
  low-dimensional representations of speech from socio-auditory structures for 
  phonetic analyses". Journal of Phonetics.
