Description: Functions for applying Laplacian Eigenmaps to acoustic data for 
  the purpose of phonetic analysis. Includes data sets of adult speakers'
  productions of American English /s, S/ and of productions of /t, k/. 
  Vignettes apply Laplacian Eigenmaps to high-dimensional spectral 
  representations so as to learn low-dimensional representations for the  
  /s/-vs-/S/ and the /t/-vs-/k/ contrasts, respectively.
